# Robot Day Donkey Car Activity

The [AI Racing League](https://www.coderdojotc.org/ai-racing-league/)
is a project designed to introduce Python, AI and
machine learning to high-school and college students.
As a result, all our Robot Day activities have one
or more Donkey Cars available for use at these events.

## ChatGPT Prompt

```linenums="0"
Create a five minute description of a Donkey Car
for a student at a Robotics Day event.
Assume the student is a fifth-grade student.

Include the following facts:

- The Donkey Car is a autonomous car built on a RC car chassis.
- It has a Raspberry Pi model 4 and a camera.
- It uses a chassis that is created on a 3D printer
- The parts together cost about $310
- The car is used to teach AI and machine learning.
- It is programmed with Python.
- To control it, students drive around a track and
gather images. These images are use to train
a neural network.  The neural network then is
used to predict the speed and steering to
drive the car around a track without a human.

Return the result in a single pure raw markdown file.
