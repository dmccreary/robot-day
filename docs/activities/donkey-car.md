# Robot Day Donkey Car Activity

## ChatGPT Prompt

```linenums="0"
Create a five minute description of a Donkey Car for a student at a Robotics Day event.
Assume the student is a fith-grade student.

Include the following facts:

This Donkey Car is a autonomous car built on a RC car chassis.
It has a Raspberry Pi model 4 and a camera.
It uses a chassis that is created on a 3D printer
The parts together cost about $310
The car is used to teach AI and machine learning.
It is programmed with Python.
To control it, students drive around a track and
gather images.  These images are use to train
a neural network.  The neural network then is
used to predict the speed and steering to
drive the care without a human.

Return the result in a single raw markdown file.
