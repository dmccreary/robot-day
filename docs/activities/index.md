# Sample Robot Day Activities

This section of our website features the hands-on activities
that we have developed for Robot Day.  The activities
usually begin with simple discussions about batteries
and motors.  They then proceed through sensors, displays
and microcontrollers.

Our activities wrap up at the [Robot Corral](../glossary.md#robot-corral) when the students get to interact directly with the collision avoidance
robots.

Each activity can be tuned to the grade level and interests
of the students.  These activities are designed to appeal to a wide range of students
through dialogs that have been customized for grades 1 to 12.

Depending on your experience with these events, you can do
a single activity on each table or combine multiple activities
on tables.  For example, the motor table can combine four different
hands-on activities.
