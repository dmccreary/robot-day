# Moving Rainbow

![](../img/moving-rainbow.jpg)

The Moving Rainbow is the name of our labs that use a
bright and colorful LED strip to teach programming concepts.

The photo above is a 12-pixel version that is on a breadboard
with a voltage monitor and a rechargeable LoPo battery.  This
project can be used in multiple locations and can be used to:

1. See what happens when a battery is not plugged in
2. See what happens when a GND or 5V wire is removed
3. Teach the basics of a breadboard
4. Show what the voltage is coming out of the Pico 3.3V pin
