In this lab, students will hold a box that has a potentiometer on the side.
As the students change the potentiometer, the display will change.

There are two types of displays:

1. A low-cost 10-pixel LED strip.  This keeps the cost of the box under $10.
2. A medium cost that uses an OLED display.  This allows the students
to see the history of their turning the knob.
