# Robot Day LED Breadboard Activity

## Prompot

We have the following materials:

1. a half-size solderless breadboard
2. a 3-volt battery pack
3. different colors of 3mm LEDs
4. 220-ohm resistors
5. momentary switch buttons

Design an activity for a 5th-grade student interested in robots.  The activity should last about 5-10 minutes.  The activity will be lead by an adult volunteer.  Provide a clear description of this activity including some hands-on things that the student will do to earn a checkbox towards a robot expert badge.

Return the response as a single raw markdown file that is easy to download.

## Response

### Objective
To introduce 5th-grade students to basic electronics and circuit design through a hands-on activity, fostering their interest in robotics. This activity will help students earn a checkbox toward a robot expert badge.

### Materials
1. Half-size solderless breadboard
2. 3-volt battery pack
3. Different colors of 3mm LEDs
4. 220-ohm resistors
5. Momentary switch buttons

### Duration
5-10 minutes

### Activity Description
#### Step 1: Introduction (1 minute)
- The adult volunteer explains the basic concept of a circuit and its relevance in robotics.
- Briefly introduce the materials: breadboard, LEDs, resistors, battery pack, and switch buttons.

#### Step 2: Building a Simple Circuit (3 minutes)
- Guide the student to place a LED on the breadboard.
- Show them how to connect the LED to the battery pack using wires.
- Explain the importance of resistors and help them add a 220 ohm resistor to the circuit.

#### Step 3: Adding a Switch (2 minutes)
- Introduce the momentary switch button.
- Assist the student in incorporating the switch into their circuit, explaining how it controls the flow of electricity.

#### Step 4: Testing and Exploration (3 minutes)
- Let the student test their circuit by pressing the switch to light up the LED.
- Encourage them to experiment with different colored LEDs and observe the differences.

#### Step 5: Conclusion (1 minute)
- Discuss with the students what they learned and how it applies to robotics.
- Award the checkbox towards the robot expert badge.

#### Safety Note
Ensure adult supervision at all times, especially when handling the battery pack and electronic components.
