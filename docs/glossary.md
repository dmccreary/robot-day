A checklist of items that students need to complete to earn their robot expert badge.

#### Robot Corral

A region of the Robot Day floor space that is dedicated to allowing the collision avoidance robots to run free.  The corral is typically about six feet in diameter and the wall height is about six inches.  The corral fence is usually made of cardboard that can be quickly folded up.  Some corrals have "NASCAR" type signage that references the sponsors of your local Robot Day event.

We provide a variety of PowerPoint templates you can customize to add
