**Lesson Plan Title: Exploring Battery Science in Robotics**

**Grade Level: 9th Grade Robotics Class**

**Duration: 1 Hour**

**Objective:**
Students will understand the different types of batteries, their voltage, capacity, rechargeability, and application in robotics. They will learn to measure and calculate the power and energy provided by different batteries and gain hands-on experience by powering a motor with each type.

**Materials:**
- Coin Cell Battery (CR2052)
- LiPo Battery
- AAA Batteries
- AA Batteries
- 9-volt Battery
- 18650 Battery
- Wires
- Small Motors
- Battery Meters
- Volt-Ohm Meters
- Robotics Class Battery Chart (from the image provided)
- Handouts with battery specifications

**Lesson Plan:**

**Introduction (10 minutes):**
- Begin with a discussion on the importance of batteries in robotics.
- Introduce the five types of batteries: Coin Cell, LiPo, AAA, AA, 9-volt, and 18650.
- Briefly discuss voltage, capacity, and rechargeability.

**Direct Instruction (15 minutes):**
- Present the Robotics Class Battery Chart. Discuss each battery type, its voltage, and capacity.
- Explain the concepts of voltage, current, resistance, and power.
- Demonstrate how to use a volt-ohm meter to measure battery voltage.

**Guided Practice (15 minutes):**
- Divide students into small groups. Provide each group with a set of batteries, wires, motors, battery meters, and volt-ohm meters.
- Have students measure the voltage of each battery type using the volt-ohm meters.
- Guide students through calculating the power (P=VI) each battery can deliver.
- Students will then connect each battery to a small motor and observe the operation.

**Independent Practice (15 minutes):**
- Students will use their measurements and calculations to determine which battery is best suited for various robotic applications.
- They will complete a worksheet where they match battery types to specific robotic components based on power requirements.

**Conclusion (5 minutes):**
- Have a group discussion on the findings. Ask students which battery they would choose for different robotics scenarios and why.
- Emphasize the importance of proper battery usage and disposal.

**Assessment:**
- Participation in group activities.
- Completion of the worksheet.
- Short reflections on what they learned about the different batteries and their applications in robotics.

**Homework:**
- Students will write a one-page essay on the environmental impact of batteries in technology and propose sustainable practices for battery usage and disposal in the field of robotics.
