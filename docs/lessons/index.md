# Sample Dialogs and Lesson Plans

We use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 to generate
the first draft of many of these lesson plans.  We then compare
them with the manually created lesson plans created by humans.
We then go back and refine the prompts to create the outputs
that work best.  This process is called Prompt Engineering, and
it is one of the key skills we hope to bring to future events.

One of the nice features of ChatGPT is its ability to recognize
images.  Once we create an Activity Board, we can upload a
photo of the board to generate lesson plans for different
grade levels.  We are using Python and LangChain to
generate a matrix of these lesson plans for all of the
activities for grades 1 to 12.

## Sample Code 

Here is some sample code for generating gustom lesson plans for
multiple grades and multiple topics.
