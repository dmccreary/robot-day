# High-Level Concepts in STEM Robotics

## Robot Parts

1. What are the key parts of a robot?
2. Where do they get their power from?
3. How do they move around?
4. How do they sense the world around them?
5. What do they use to gather signals and control their motion?

## Power Sources

1. What do power plugs like wall outlets and USB ports do?
2. What are batteries?
3. What are solar cells?
4. How do switches control the flow of power?
5. What is an open switch?
6. What is a closed switch?

## Batteries

1. What different types of batteries are there?
2. Coin cell batteries for small devices like hearing aids
3. Small lightweight LiPo rechargeable for drones
3. AA and AA
4. 9-volt batteries for smoke detectors
5. Larger LiPo rechargeable (18650)
6. Batteries have polarity - positive and negative
7. More batteries mean more power
8. Batteries have capacity ratings (milli-amp hours)
9. Batteries have voltage ratings (such as 1.5 volts, 9 volts, or 3.2 volts)

## Motors

1. What are the parts of a simple DC hobby motor?
2. How many wires are there?
3. How do you make a motor run with a battery?

### Motor Direction

1. For robots to move both forward and backward they need to be able to reverse the direction of a motor
2. How can we change the direction of a motor?

### H-Bridge

1. What are H-Bridges are circuits?
2. How can they reverse the direction of a motor by opening and closing switches?
2. How do they change the direction of current flow?

## Sensors

1. How many senses do people have?
2. If you were a robot that had to avoid crashing into a wall, what types of sensors would you use?
