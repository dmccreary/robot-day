**Different Batteries for Different Tasks**

**Hey Super Students!**

Today, we're going on a battery adventure! Batteries are like tiny treasure chests that store energy instead of gold. Let's discover the types of batteries we have here and what makes each one special.

Have you seen any of these batteries around your home?  Which ones do you
recognize?  Which ones are new to you?  Let's take a look at each one.

First up is the **Coin Cell Battery**. See the small, shiny one? It's named because it looks like a coin. This little hero gives power to things that don't need much energy, like your watch or calculator. It has 3 volts, which is like saying it has the strength of three mini-power kicks.

Next, we have the **LiPo Battery**. It's a thin, rectangular one. 'LiPo' is short for Lithium Polymer, and it's the energy ninja for cool gadgets like drones. It’s rechargeable and has 3.7 volts, so it's a little stronger than the coin cell.  This one was used in a small RC helicopter.

Then, there are the **AAA and AA Batteries**. They're like the popular kids in the battery world because they fit into so many of our toys and tools. They have 1.5 volts, not super strong, but great for things like your remote control car.
We will use these in our robots today.

The **9-volt Battery** is the one with the two little caps on top. It’s like the guardian because it's often used in smoke detectors to keep us safe. With 9 volts, it's got the power of nine mini-kicks!

Last, but not least, meet the **18650 Battery**. This blue cylinder is the marathon runner of batteries because it can be charged and used again and again. It has a big energy capacity, which means it can keep your robots running for a long time!

Batteries also have something called *milliamp hours*, written like 'milliamp hours'. It's like the battery’s stamina, telling us how long it can keep going before it needs a rest (or a recharge!).

**Remember, Super Students:**
- Coin Cell - Small but mighty for tiny tasks.
- LiPo - Thin and rechargeable, for high-tech toys.
- AAA and AA - Common and handy for everyday play.
- 9-volt - The safety champion with extra kick.
- 18650 - The reusable power source that lasts and lasts.

Batteries are super important in our lives. They're like mini power stations for all our gadgets. But always remember, when they're out of energy, we should recycle them properly to help our planet!

**Keep Exploring, Keep Learning!**
