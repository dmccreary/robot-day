# Robot Day Tables

Tables are logical groupings of activities.  At most events, a table is a six-foot wide table with hands-on activities on it.  The focus is to get kids to use their hands and fingers to make a change and see how their actions change the world.  This can be seeing a motor spinning, and LED brightness change or a display changing a pattern.
