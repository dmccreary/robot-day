# Robot Day!

![](./img/robot-day-banner.png)

Welcome to the Robot Day website.  This website contains resources
to help your organization host a fun kid-friendly robot day
for your community.  These events are hosted by science museums, schools, libraries, coding clubs, scouting troupes, and community centers.  The events promote fun learning
about STEM concepts for kids ages 5 to 18.

We have been testing these events for almost five years, and we think
we have some thoughtfully designed and tested activities that are fun and cost-effective to promote inclusion by organizations with modest budgets of just a few hundred dollars.

Please let me know if you have any feedback!
