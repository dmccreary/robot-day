# Robot Day!

![](./img/robot-day-banner.png)

Welcome to the Robot Day website.  This site is full of resources
to help your organization host a fun kid-friendly robot day
for your community.

We have been testing these events for almost five years and we think
we have some thoughtfully designed and tested activities from students
from first grade through seniors in high school.

Please let me know if you have any feedback!
