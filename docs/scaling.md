# Scaling Down and Up

You can scale your robot day to be a single table and cost under $100 to large events that cost over $10,000 and last for multiple days.  Here are some suggestions.

## Single Table Event

If you have a science fair you can start with a single table.  This might include:

1. Batteries - packs of 2-3 AA batteries
2. LEDs
3. Small DC Hobby Motors
4. Breadboards
5. Distance sensor (IR)
6. Microcontroller
7. Collision Avoidance Robot in a corral on the floor

## Two Table Event

Same as the single table but add a second table for sensors and displays

## Three Table Event

Add a third table and include more motor labs, PWM labs, more sensors and more displays

## Four Table Lab

1. Motors
2. Sensors
3. Displays
4. Collision Avoidance Robot
