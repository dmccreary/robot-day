# Scaling Down and Up

You can scale your robot day to be a single table and cost under $100 to large events that cost over $10,000 and last for multiple days.  Here are some suggestions.

## Single Table Event Set Up

If you have a science fair you can start with a single table.  This might include:

1. Batteries - packs of 2-3 AA batteries
2. LEDs
3. Small DC Hobby Motors
4. Breadboards
5. Distance sensor (IR)
6. Microcontroller
7. Collision Avoidance Robot in a corral on the floor

## Two Table Set Up

Same as the single table but add a second table for sensors and displays

1. Table 1:
    1. Batteries - packs of 2-3 AA batteries
    2. LEDs
    3. Small DC Hobby Motors
    4. Breadboards
2. Table 2:
    1. Sensors
    2. Displays

## Three Table Set Up

Add a third table and include more motor labs, PWM labs, more sensors and more displays

1. Table 1:
    1. Batteries - packs of 2-3 AA batteries
    2. LEDs
    3. Small DC Hobby Motors
    4. Breadboards
2. Table 2:
    1. Sensors
3. Table 3
    2. Displays

## Four Table Setup

1. Registration, Batteries and Motors
2. Sensors
3. Displays
4. Microcontrollers

3. Displays
4. Microcontrollers
5. Coding

## Ten Table Large Event

This event has about $5,000 in materials and requires 10-mentors each with 40-hours of training.

1. Welcome and Registration
2. Batteries
3. Motors
4. Sensors and Cameras
5. Displays
6. Microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi
7. Coding, UNIX Shell
8. AI Racing League, Machine Learning
9. Calibration
10. GPU and Machine Learning
