# Sensors

!!! prompt "Prompt Text"
    Above is an image of a poster board we are using
    for our Robot Day at our school to teach students
    about sensors.

    Please create a sample five-minute dialog between
    a teacher/volunteer/mentor and a student about this
    board and how we use time-of-flight sensors to
    measure the distance between our robot and the
    wall of the corral wall that encloses our robots.
