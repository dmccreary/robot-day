Create a process flow diagram in mermaid format that describes the following steps:

## Sample Greeting Dialog

**Greeter:** *Do you like robots? Yes? Would you like to take our robot challenge and earn this cool robot badge? Yes? Cool!*

Note: if the student looks apprehensive you can just suggest they look around
and let the greeter know if they want to take the challenge later.

**Greeter:** *Write your name at the top of this form.  If you visit all
six tables you will get this cool badge!  You can start
at the Batteries table herel*

## Table Activities

A typical list of tables for a large 24'x36' foot room will have the following tables:

1. Checkin Table
2. [Batteries Table](./activities/batteries.md)
3. Motors Table
4. Sensors Table
5. Displays Table
5. MicroControllers Table

Which leads to the [Robot Corral](./glossary.md#robot-corral)
