This website contains resources to help your organization host a fun kid-friendly Robot Day for your community.  These events are hosted by science museums, schools, libraries, coding clubs, scouting troops, and community centers.  The events promote fun learning about STEM concepts for kids ages 5 to 18.</p> <p>We have been testing these events for almost five years, and we think we have some thoughtfully designed and tested activities that are fun and cost-effective to promote inclusion by organizations with modest budgets of just a few hundred dollars.</p> <p>In 2023 we have also started integrating generative AI into our content.  We have provided tools to help you quickle customize our content and generate MicroSims that mirror our hands-on activities.</p> <p>Please let me know if you have any feedback!</p> <p>Dan McCreary on LinkedIn</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"About The Robot Day Site","text":"<p>This Robot Day website was created by Dan McCreary after he choreographed a successful Robot Day in December of 2023.  Although he had lots of material for helping organizations create their own Robot Days, the content was spread over many websites.  It was time for all the content used in creating a Robot Day to come together as one unified resource to support fast searching and for everyone to share.</p>"},{"location":"about/#philosophy","title":"Philosophy","text":"<p>If you ask almost any kid these days the question \"Do you like robots?\" you will invariably get the answer \"Yes!\".  Kids have a fundamental curiosity about machines that move around.  Our goal is to leverage this innate curiosity about the world to teach STEM concepts - and allow the kids to have a lot of fun while they are learning.  So our core value statement is \"Help kids have fun while learning STEM!\".</p>"},{"location":"about/#focus-on-diversity-equity-and-inclusion","title":"Focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion","text":"<p>Although there are many wonderful robot kits you can assemble to bring to Robot Day, many of them are out of the price range of many schools, libraries and community centers.  This means that only wealthy schools can afford to create great educational experiences for students.</p> <p>But what if we could lower the cost of robotics \"labs\" to just tens of dollars?  This would mean that even organizations with modest budgets could afford to put on a Robot Day.  Creating fun but low-cost robotics activities takes some clever engineering and testing.</p> <p>We hope this website inspires every school, library, community center, scout troupe, or summer camp program to host their own Robot Day!</p>"},{"location":"about/#focus-on-hands-on-activities","title":"Focus on Hands-On Activities","text":"<p>I once attended a robotics event that was sponsored by a local University.  They brought two large expensive robots.  But the robots were roped off from the participants. The kids we not allowed near the robots!  This is not our approach.  Our goal is to get kids to touch and feel every battery, every motor, every display, and every sensor.  We want the kids to climb into the robot corral and interact with robots close up and personal.  We believe that learning happens best when all the senses - including touch - are involved.</p>"},{"location":"about/#age-appropriate-activities","title":"Age Appropriate Activities","text":"<p>A four-year-old girl walks into Robot Day clutching her dad's hand.  She is shy and a little overwhelmed by all the people, noise and activity.  A greeter walks up to her and asks \"Do you like colors?\".  She nods sheepishly.  The greeter holds up a box with three knobs.  Can you turn this red knob?  As the girl turns the knob a row of lights turns red.  \"Wow!  You made it turn red!  Great Job!\" says the greeter.  \"Now can you turn this green knob?\" - and as she does the lights turn green.  Next comes the blue.  \"WOW! You can program it to make it turn any color!  I bet you are going to be a robot programmer someday!\" A huge smile breaks out on the girl.</p> <p>This dialog snippet has been repeated hundreds of times at our events.  We always try to have a few of the little RGB Boxes handy for anyone who looks like they need a gentle introduction to robots.</p> <p>This story illustrates the need for an adaptive set of activities for anyone who enters our events.  Although the event might only be advertised to ages 5-12, you can bet that younger or older siblings will attend.</p> <p>The RGB Box is somewhat of a special case.  It fits magically into the need for a simple, colorful hands-on activity for our youngest audience.  It is a favorite of our staff. Knowing how to create these devices and when to use them will be part of our lessons.</p> <p>The underlying goal is to be as flexible as possible and not force activities that are not age-appropriate for your audience.  Having a rich set of dialogs ready for each age group used to be challenging.  With tools like ChatGPT, lesson plans for all ages can be generated and taped to the back of the presentation boards.</p>"},{"location":"about/#creative-commons-license","title":"Creative Commons License","text":"<p>All content is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 DEED)</p> <p>Please read our Creative Commons License Agreement for details.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/","title":"High-Level Concepts in STEM Robotics","text":"<p>This page is a high-level list of some of the concepts that we teach during Robot Days.

Batteries are like tiny treasure chests that store energy instead of gold. Let's discover the types of batteries we have here and what makes each one special.</p> <p>Have you seen any of these batteries around your home?  Which ones do you recognize?  Which ones are new to you?  Let's take a look at each one.</p> <p>First up is the Coin Cell Battery. See the small, shiny one? It's named because it looks like a coin. This little hero gives power to things that don't need much energy, like your watch or calculator. It has 3 volts, which is like saying it has the strength of three mini-power kicks.</p> <p>Next, we have the LiPo Battery. It's a thin, rectangular one. 'LiPo' is short for Lithium Polymer, and it's the energy ninja for cool gadgets like drones. It\u2019s rechargeable and has 3.7 volts, so it's a little stronger than the coin cell.  This one was used in a small RC helicopter.</p> <p>Then, there are the AAA and AA Batteries. They're like the popular kids in the battery world because they fit into so many of our toys and tools. They have 1.5 volts, not super strong, but great for things like your remote control car. We will use these in our robots today.</p> <p>The 9-volt Battery is the one with the two little caps on top. It\u2019s like the guardian because it's often used in smoke detectors to keep us safe. With 9 volts, it's got the power of nine mini-kicks!</p> <p>Last, but not least, meet the 18650 Battery. This blue cylinder is the marathon runner of batteries because it can be charged and used again and again. It has a big energy capacity, which means it can keep your robots running for a long time!</p> <p>Batteries also have something called milliamp hours, written like 'milliamp hours'. It's like the battery\u2019s stamina, telling us how long it can keep going before it needs a rest (or a recharge!).</p> <p>Remember, Super Students: - Coin Cell - Small but mighty for tiny tasks. - LiPo - Thin and rechargeable, for high-tech toys. - AAA and AA - Common and handy for everyday play. - 9-volt - The safety champion with extra kick. - 18650 - The reusable power source that lasts and lasts.</p> <p>Batteries are super important in our lives. They're like mini power stations for all our gadgets. But always remember, when they're out of energy, we should recycle them properly to help our planet!</p> <p>Keep Exploring, Keep Learning!</p>"},{"location":"lesson-plans/batteries-9th-grade/","title":"9th Grade Robotics Class Lesson Plan","text":"<p>Lesson Plan Title: Exploring Battery Science in Robotics</p> <p>Grade Level: 9th Grade Robotics Class</p> <p>Duration: 1 Hour</p> <p>Objective: Students will understand the different types of batteries, their voltage, capacity, rechargeability, and application in robotics.
