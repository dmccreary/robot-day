Kids have a fundamental curiosity about machines that move around.  Our goal is to leverage this innate curiosity about the world to teach STEM concepts - and allow the kids to have a lot of fun while they are learning.  So our core value statement is \"Help kids have fun while learning STEM!\".</p>"},{"location":"about/#finding-the-froebel-gifts-for-teaching-stem","title":"Finding The \"Froebel Gifts\" for Teaching STEM","text":"<p>In the 19th century, German educator Friedrich Froebel pioneered many of the ideas we know today as \"Kindergarten\". Froebel also designed a set of play materials to provide an idealized learning environment for young children.  These Froebel Gifts were designed as hands-on devices that help children learn about their world.</p> <p>Each \"gift\" was a set of play materials ranging from simple geometric shapes to more complex building blocks and activity sets, intended to stimulate learning through play and exploration in a nurturing environment. These gifts were instrumental in the early development of educational theory and practice, influencing many educationalists and even artists and architects with their emphasis on learning through structured play and creativity.</p> <p>For the Robot Day project, we seek the \"Froebel Gifts\" for teaching STEM and robotics.  We know that these items will be physical devices that the kids will hold in their hands and will help them discover how the world around them works.  We think we have found a few of these gifts already and we are refining others.</p> <p>Some of our \"activities\" and \"project boxes\" are simple:</p> <ol> <li>A battery and an LED in a circuit with a switch.</li> <li>A battery and a motor that you can reverse directions.</li> <li>A Box with knobs that mix red, green and blue light.</li> </ol> <p>Other activities are more advanced inside to illustrate ideas:</p> <ol> <li>An H-Bridge box that shows current flowing to reverse a motor.</li> <li>A sensor with a display that changes.</li> <li>A collision avoidance robot.</li> </ol> <p>We know there are other clever devices out there we have not yet discovered.  But with your help, we hope we can work together to develop, refine and test these activities to build awesome learning experiences for our students.</p>"},{"location":"about/#focus-on-diversity-equity-and-inclusion","title":"Focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion","text":"<p>Although there are many wonderful robot kits you can assemble to bring to Robot Day, many of them are out of the price range of many schools, libraries and community centers.  This means that only wealthy schools can afford to create great educational experiences for students.</p> <p>But what if we could lower the cost of robotics \"labs\" to just tens of dollars?  This would mean that even organizations with modest budgets could afford to put on a Robot Day.

They brought two large expensive robots.  But the robots were roped off from the participants. The kids we not allowed near the robots!  This is not our approach.  Our goal is to get kids to touch and feel every battery, every motor, every wire, every sensor, every display, and every robot.  We want the kids to climb into the robot corral and interact with robots close up and personal.  And yes, at every event we seem to have a few kids (and mentors) step on a few robots. But that is OK.  We have low-cost interchangeable parts and a lot of hot glue! We believe that learning happens best when all the senses - including touch - are involved.</p>"},{"location":"about/#age-appropriate-activities","title":"Age Appropriate Activities","text":"<p>A four-year-old girl walks into Robot Day clutching her dad's hand.  She is shy and a little overwhelmed by all the people, noise and activity.  A greeter walks up to her and asks \"Do you like colors?\".  She nods sheepishly.  The greeter holds up a box with three knobs.  Can you turn this red knob?  As the girl turns the knob a row of lights turns red.  \"Wow!  You made it turn red!  Great Job!\" says the greeter.  \"Now can you turn this green knob?\" - and as she does the lights turn green.  Next comes the blue.  \"WOW! You can program it to make it turn any color!  I bet you are going to be a robot programmer someday!\" A huge smile breaks out on the girl.</p> <p>This dialog snippet has been repeated hundreds of times at our events.  We always try to have a few of the little RGB Boxes handy for anyone who looks like they need a gentle introduction to robots.</p> <p>This story illustrates the need for an adaptive set of activities for anyone who enters our events.  Although the event might only be advertised to ages 5-12, you can bet that younger or older siblings will attend.</p> <p>The RGB Box is somewhat of a special case.  It fits magically into the need for a simple, colorful hands-on activity for our youngest audience.  It is a favorite of our staff. Knowing how to create these devices and when to use them will be part of our lessons.</p> <p>The underlying goal is to be as flexible as possible and not force activities that are not age-appropriate for your audience.  Having a rich set of dialogs ready for each age group used to be challenging.  With tools like ChatGPT, lesson plans for all ages can be generated and taped to the back of the presentation boards.</p>"},{"location":"about/#creative-commons-license","title":"Creative Commons License","text":"<p>All content is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 DEED)</p> <p>Please read our Creative Commons License Agreement for details.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/","title":"High-Level Concepts in STEM Robotics","text":"<p>This page is a high-level list of some of the concepts that we teach during Robot Days.

Finding low-cost robotics kits that focus on teaching computational thinking is hard.  Retailers focus on families with high disposable incomes that are not sensitive to price.  Retailers like Amazon frequently take 30% margins and robot parts suppliers are forced to pay their fees and use their warehouses.  Amazon uses every opportunity to use AI to keep its profit margins high.  That puts the burden on teachers and  event organizers to be clever and find the best value for your organization.</p> <p>As one example, let's take the \"2WD Smart Robot Car Chassis\" problem.</p> <p>Here are some identical items:</p> <p></p> <p>The price for the chassis alone varies from $3.80 to $95!  You can find similar items by searching for \"2WD Smart Robot Car Chassis\".</p> <p>The first item is probably priced by an AI agent that is a little out of touch with reality.  The second from the retailer  BOTs and four DOTs is a lot more reasonable. But the Cytron listing clearly not only has a lower price, but the price goes down if you order multiple items.</p> <p>If you don't have worries about budgets, the vendor SparkFun sells high-quality parts and you can filter by which robots support MicroPython like Kitronik Autonomous Robotics Platform for Pico.

We reviewed the dialog and made a few minor changes.</p> <p>You: Hey there! I heard you're interested in robots. That's really cool! Do you know what makes them move around?</p> <p>Student: Yeah! They need power to drive their motors, right?</p> <p>You: Exactly! And that power comes from batteries. Let's look at these two battery testers. Can you tell the difference between the two?</p> <p>Student: One has numbers and the other has a color gauge.</p> <p>You: That's right! The one with numbers is called a digital battery tester. It gives us a precise voltage reading, like 1.22 volts for this battery. The other one, with the colors, is an analog battery tester. It shows us if the battery is good, low, or needs to be replaced.</p> <p>Student: So, which one is better for our robot?</p> <p>You: Good question! For robots, especially the ones that avoid running into things, we need to make sure they have enough power. A digital tester can tell us exactly how much power is left, so we know when to change the battery.</p> <p>Student: What happens if the battery is low?</p> <p>You: If a robot's battery is low, it might not move as fast or react quickly enough to avoid obstacles. That's why we always check the batteries before we start a robot.</p> <p>Student: Can I try testing a battery?</p> <p>You: Of course! Here, use this digital tester and press the battery against the contacts. What's the voltage?</p> <p>Student: It says 1.22 volts!</p> <p>You: Right. And since a brand new AA battery has about 1.5 volts, 1.22 volts means it's been used a bit but should still work. Now let's try the analog tester. What does it show?</p> <p>Student: It's in the green area! So it's good?</p> <p>You: Yes! Green means the battery still has enough power for our robot. Now, if you were building a robot, how do you think you would decide when to change its batteries?</p> <p>Student: Hmm, maybe I'd use the digital one to check if it's below 1.2 volts because then it might not work as well.</p> <p>You: That's a smart idea! With robots, we need consistent power for the best performance. So monitoring the battery life is important. You're thinking like a real robotics engineer now!</p> <p>Student: Awesome! Can we try putting the battery in a robot and see it move?</p> <p>You: Let's do that. Remember, if our robot starts slowing down, what do you think we should do?</p> <p>Student: Check the battery with the tester!</p> <p>You: Perfect! You're ready to keep your robot moving and avoid all those obstacles.</p>"},{"location":"activities/breadboard/","title":"Robot Day Breadboard Activity","text":"<p>Solderless breadboards are a core tool we use in our Robot Day activities.
